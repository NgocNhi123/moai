# Colors (index page)

For recommended color usages, see [Text][1], [Background][2], and [Border][3].
They provide accessible colors that are automatically changed based on the
current theme.

For colors that are persistent across themes, see [Static Colors][4].

For colors that have no semantic meaning and should be used for data
visualizations, see [Category Colors][5]
