# Form

Moai doesn't come with a built-in form solution. Instead, our input components
(like [Input][3] and [TextArea][4]) are designed to work with popular form
builders (such as [Formik][1] and [React Hook Form][2]) out of the box.

## Formik

To use Moai's input components with Formik, pass them to the "as" prop of
Formik's [Field][1] component:

[1]: https://formik.org/docs/api/field

```tsx
import { Field } from "formik";
import { Input } from "../../../core/src";

<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<Field id="email" type="email" name="email" as={Input} />
```

To show errors, pass FormError to the "component" prop of Formik's
[ErrorMessage][2] component:

```tsx
import { ErrorMessage } from "formik";
import { FormError } from "../../../core/src";

<ErrorMessage name="email" component={FormError} />;
```

[2]: https://formik.org/docs/api/errormessage

Full example:

<FormikExample />

```tsx
// [!include ~/form/formik.tsx:usage]
```

## React Hook Form

To use Moai's input components with React Hook Form, [render][2] them in the
"render" prop of RHF's [Controller][1] component:

```tsx
import { Controller } from "react-hook-form";
import { Input } from "../../../core/src";

<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<Controller
	name="email"
	control={control}
	render={({ field }) => (
		<Input {...field} id="email" type="email" />
	)}
	rules={{ required: "Email is required" }}
/>
```

[2]: https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#IntegratingwithUIlibraries

To show errors, pass RHF's [error messages][3] as children of Moai's FormError
component:

```tsx
import { FormError } from "../../../core/src";

<FormError children={errors.email?.message} />;
```

[3]: https://react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage#ErrorMessages

Full example:

<ReactHookFormExample />

```tsx
// [!include ~/form/react-hook-form.tsx:usage]
```
