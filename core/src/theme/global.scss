/*

MOAI's theming is exclusive, which means at one point there should be only
one selector valid. This means the styles of that selector is applied without
overriding any other styles from the other theme

Note 1: The "not" selectors prevents the style from leaking into other theme. For
example, without "not", our CSS would be:

.html { foo }
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { html { bar } }

And the outcome of (auto: dark) is that both "bar" and "foo" will be applied
