# Design Principles

## Accessibility

- Accessible, technical and visual
- Friendly to human:
	- Buttons have border, shadow to easily recognize
	- Built-in colors pass WCAG AA
- Friendly to machine:
	- Icon-only buttons always have aria-label
	- Always use native tag (Table, Select)
- Out commitment: 95/100 of Lighthouse a11y score for apps built with Moai

## Interoperability

- Leverage current solutions
- No built-in form builder, compatible with Formik and ReactHookForm
- No built-in icon set, compatible with react-icons (remix, material, fa, you name it)
- Compatible with Tailwind

## Extension

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle
- Public, stable API to extend
- No CSS customization, no style overriding
- Pseudo-headless
- Interface-over-string extension style

## Developer Experience

- Strictness over convenient
- Maintainability-first
- TypeScript strict mode
- In-code documentation
- Commitment: 24-hour response

## Modern

- https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement
- Our baseline: > 1% browsers (e.g. no IE, non-chromium Edge)
- Direction: progressive enhancement
- Example: native vs custom date input
- Example: still have CJS
